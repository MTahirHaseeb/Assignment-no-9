//  Question no 6
//  Write a Bubble Sort algorithm in Typescript. 
// Note: Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted,
// sample Data: [6,4,0,3,-2,1]
// expected output:[-2,0,1,3,4]
var arr = [6, 4, 0, 3, -2, 1];
arr.sort();
console.log(arr);
